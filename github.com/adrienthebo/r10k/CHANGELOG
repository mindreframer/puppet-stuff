CHANGELOG
=========

1.0.0
-----

2013-05-30

This is a backwards incompatible bugfix and feature release.

### Configuration

The configuration file format of 0.0.9 should be compatible with 1.0.0, and any
issues with that should be considered a bug.

A longstanding issue was confusion between symbols and strings in r10k.yaml
(GH-18). To resolve this, symbols and strings will be treated equally and
should produce the same behavior. In the long run, symbols will probably be
deprecated for the sake of conformity.

### Command line invocation

A number of commands have been renamed. They still but will emit a deprecation
warning and will redirect to the new command implementation. The only
exceptions is the are the `r10k environment cache` and `r10k environment stale`
commands, but they were pretty much useless anyways.

Log level verbosity can now be specified by level name instead of level number.
If --verbose is passed without a level, it will set the log level to `info`.

### Puppetfile support

r10k can be used to deploy modules from a standalone Puppetfile. See
`r10k puppetfile` for more information.

Modules without a version in the format of 'foo/bar' will be assumed. (GH-21)

### API

r10k handles versioning according to SemVer; since this is a major release this
is a backwards incompatible API change. It's unlikely that this has had any
extensions written on top of it, but if you have, then heads up. However, all
versions of 1.x should be backwards compatible.

### Bugfixes

A number of bugs were due to underlying architecture flaws. Part of 1.0.0 has
been a significant architectural overhaul, so on top of all of the above
changes there should be a lot of other bugs that have been fixed.
